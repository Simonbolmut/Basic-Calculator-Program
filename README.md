## 🧮 Basic Calculator Program

This is a simple Python program that performs basic arithmetic operations: **addition**, **subtraction**, **multiplication**, and **division**.

### 🚀 How It Works

1. The program prompts the user to:
   - Enter the **first number**.
   - Enter an **operator** (`+`, `-`, `*`, or `/`).
   - Enter the **second number**.

2. It then performs the operation based on the input and prints the result.

3. If the user tries to divide by zero or enters an invalid operator, the program will display an error message.

### 📝 Example

```
Enter the first number: 10  
Enter an operator (+, -, *, /): +  
Enter the second number: 5  
10.0 + 5.0 = 15.0
```

### 🧑‍💻 Requirements
